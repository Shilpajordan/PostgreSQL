## Why Use Postgres?
- Postgres is an object relational database that is just as fast as MySQL that adheres more closely to SQL standards and excels at concurrency.
- Postgres is also superior at avoiding data corruption.
- Postgres also provides more advanced data types and allows for the creation of custom types, operators and index types. 
- Postgres is normally the best option when extensibility, scalability and data integrity are most important to you. 
## What is a Database
- A database is data that is structured into rows and columns like a spreadsheet. To receive or change data in a database you send it commands called queries. 
- The database in turn returns a result based on that request.
- Databases contain many tables of data organized into rows and columns. Each column represents one type of data the database stores. 
- Each row contains multiple pieces of data specific to each entity you are describing.
-  For example we store information on students here. Each individual value stored is called a cell. 
- Primary keys are used to define unique entities in your tables. Here id provides a unique value associated with each student.
