# PostgreSQL with PgAdmin4
## Why Use Postgres?
- Postgres is an object relational database that is just as fast as MySQL that adheres more closely to SQL standards and excels at concurrency.
- Postgres is also superior at avoiding data corruption.
- Postgres also provides more advanced data types and allows for the creation of custom types, operators and index types. 
- Postgres is normally the best option when extensibility, scalability and data integrity are most important to you.
